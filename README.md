Hangman Homework

Hey! Welcome to my page. This is a hangman project developed as homework for the UT Austin Boot Camp. 
It's quite simple; type a letter into the Guess field to register it as a guess. Correct answers will replace blanks on the 
jumbotron, and incorrect answers will populate the block under the Guess field and add a body part to the Hangman image.

The game deletes a word from the list of possible words every time it's used. You can win the game by guessing all the words correctly.
Good luck!
